          <h2 class="title top_90 box-animation">People Who Employ Me</h2>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">I am the Regional Manager for the U.S.A. and Canada at <a href="https://www.techstars.com">Techstars Central LLC</a>, and founder/owner of <a href="https://suego.co?utm_source=stevenarodriguez.com" target="_blank">SUEGO</a>&trade; (including the <a href="https://www.bloomshift.com?utm_source=stevenarodriguez.com">BloomShift</a>&trade;, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bogoweek.co" target="_blank">BOGOWEEK</a>&trade;, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brijx.co" target="_blank">BRIJX</a>&trade; and Community Crafting&trade; brands) and <a href="https://innovatecoalition.org?utm_source=stevenarodriguez.com" target="_blank">Innovate Coalition</a>&trade; (herewith “ORGS”).

          <h2 class="title top_90 box-animation">Statement on Affiliate Marketing</h2>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation"><strong>I’m going to try to make money off of you</strong>. Let me repeat that. <strong>I AM GOING TO TRY TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF YOU</strong>. I’ll post stuff for sale on which I get paid a commission. I’ll post stuff for my employer to benefit my salary, so assume a bias there. I use Amazon, Linkshare, Commission Junction, Shareasale, and anyone else who will shovel cash my way. You should too. <strong>Assume that I’m getting paid by someone</strong>, though I’ll use in-post disclosures when and where I can.</p>

          <p class="top_90 top_90 box-animation"><strong><i>My only promise to you is that I won’t market crap to you. If I try to sell you something, at least it’ll be the good stuff</i></strong>.</p>

          <h2 class="title box-animation">Statement on Content</h2>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">This is my blog. It’s like my living room, only online. I do with it as I like, as you should do in your own living room. If you were to come into my living room, demand free beer and chips, then crap on the floor and break the windows, I’d probably put your porch lights out, if you know what I mean. If you do the digital equivalent, I’ll do the same.</p>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">Plain English: I reserve the right to do whatever I want on my personal blog with content, including updating, editing, and deleting without warning or notice.</p>

          <h2 class="title top_90 box-animation">Statement on Unsolicited Items</h2>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">You’re welcome to send them to me, but they’re not coming back. Ever. Especially if the cat gets to it.</p>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">By sending me something to review, you understand that I may or may not review it, and I do not guarantee any outcome of the review. I also do not guarantee a review in a timely manner unless you want to pay for a review.</p>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">If your product sucks, I’m going to say so in no uncertain words.</p>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">If it’s delivered electronically, I may never even see it due to spam filters.</p>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">If it’s tangible, there’s a distinct chance it’ll get lost in my office somewhere and I won’t find it until months later, possibly after you’ve gone out of business. I’ll still review it and lament your passing if that’s the case.</p>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">If I do review something, I will disclose it, no exceptions.</p>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">If it’s great, I’ll tell people about it.
          <br/>If it’s terrible, likewise.
          <br/>If it’s mediocre, there’s a good chance it will make so little an impression that I’ll forget to review it entirely.</p>
          <p class="top_90 box-animation">Be awesome, okay?</p>
